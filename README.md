- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack Puncochar, welcome to my data science portfolio! Here is an overview of some of my recent projects.

### [College Football Play-by-Play Simulation for Daily Fantasy]

- **Objective:** Simulate college football games play-by-play using OOP in Python to develop fantasy projections. 
- **Technologies Used:** 'cfbfastR', R, Python, pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, object-oriented programming.
- **Methods:** A Reddit user developed a play-by-play simulation of NFL games: https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ew9dog/comment/fg20mw0/ to predict game results. I wanted to apply these methods to college football data and take it a step further by tracking player results. The basis of the simulation was a combination of game logic/rules and several fairly simple linear and logistic regression models that predicted key events in a football game. 
- **Results:** Football is a complex game. Several variables impact how a game plays out. Currently, the simulation can provide realistic results of football games; however, I have yet to incorporate team and player skill, which is obviously a huge component of each play. The complexity of the simulation has no bound, and I hope to iterate on this in the future.

## About Me

I have a masters in data science from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay. I am very interested in how I can leverage data to build cool things. I especially love how much sports data is out there. With the increase in the popularity of sports betting, there will be several use cases for projects similar to the ones I have already developed.

Feel free to explore each of my projects.
