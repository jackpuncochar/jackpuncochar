ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jack Puncochar, welcome to my data science portfolio! Here is an overview of some of my recent projects.

# College Football Play-by-Play Simulation for Daily Fantasy

- **Objective:** Simulate college football games play-by-play using OOP in Python to develop fantasy projections. 
- **Technologies Used:** 'cfbfastR', R, Python, pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, object-oriented programming.
- **Methods:** A Reddit user developed a play-by-play simulation of NFL games https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/ew9dog/comment/fg20mw0/ to predict game results. I wanted to apply these methods to college football data and take it a step further by tracking player results. The basis of the simulation was a combination of game logic/rules and several fairly simple linear and logistic regression models that predicted key events in a football game. 
- **Results:** Actively working on an advanced football simulation model that incorporates realistic player statistics and game outcomes. The current version accurately reflects the dynamics of the game and player distributions. I'm currently focused on refining team and player skills to enhance the simulation's realism. I look forward to ongoing iterations and improvements to capture the complexity of football simulations.

# Financial Consultant Chatbot Using Cosine Similarity

- **Objective:** Develop a chatbot that answers finance-related questions. Learn how chatbots work without getting into the complexity of large language models. Generative content is gaining popularity as companies look to automate customer service and even answer questions that employees might have regarding internal documents and processes.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, pandas, nltk, TfidVectorizer, cosine_similarity, HTML, CSS, Flask
- **Methods:** I used ChatGPT to produce 100 questions and answers related to finance and saved the results to a .csv file. Then, I used cosine similarity to find the question in the .csv that matched the user's input the closest. I pre-processed the user's input such as removing stopwords, lemmatization, and stemming (algorithms that attempt to get the true meaning of a word). The chatbot was built using Flask app and some pretty basic HTML/CSS code.  
- **Results:** The outcomes aligned with expectations as the chatbot effectively retrieved information from a pre-existing set of questions and answers, providing responses closely matched to user queries. It demonstrated proficiency in handling irrelevant questions. Future developments involve implementing a mechanism to save user inputs for scenarios where a corresponding question is absent in the dataset. Additionally, the plan is to leverage advanced language models for generating more personalized and nuanced responses, enhancing the chatbot's overall capabilities.

## About Me

I have a Master's in Data Science from the University of Wisconsin - Green Bay. I am very interested in how I can leverage data to build cool things. I especially love working with sports data. With the increase in the popularity of sports betting, there will be several use cases for projects similar to the ones I have already developed.

Feel free to explore each of my projects.
